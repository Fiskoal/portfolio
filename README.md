## Overall Notes

I tried to implement some flexbox into my code, it made it easier to align things overall.

Section "Work" is a mess. I need to restructure it heavily, notably in the HTML. I would then have to go into the CSS and change everything there, based on changes from the HTML... and then fix anything that broke. That's for another time, after I turn the assignment in.

As for mobile formatting... I think I need to focus on "mobile first" more. I made it "desktop first" and trying to go through @media commands to try and get it to look presentable on mobile was a migraine. Shout out to Chrome DevTools though, I will pray to it as my tech-overlord for as long as I live. I LOVE they mobile view tool they have. Much better than stretching my window all over the place.

My code is a mess. Things are all over the place. I can only sort through it because I am the one who has put it all there. Sorry guys, I know that if you have to look through it all it won't be fun. I plan on doing a code-cleanup when I revamp certain sections (notably, .work). Until then, I need to work on maintaining clean code as I work along.

## Things to Improve On

Mobile First!
Code-cleanliness

## Personal Notes

Use following width/height to fit the 800x500 image structure of Work (for now..)
  max-width: 85vw;
  max-height: 53.125vw;

## NOTED: HEISENBUG ??DISCOVERED??

I had issues with the #return pointer events over certain elements/divs for some reason (notably, the entire introduction div under the h1), and when trying to provoke it within the code, it fixed itself somehow. It has yet to reappear...
